  2. ``/v1/models`` → ``context_window`` or ``max_tokens`` (LiteLLM / others)
  3. Fall back to ``--context-size`` CLI override (required if auto-detect fails)

        "to 3, meaning each key is stored on three distinct physical nodes. "

    # 1: Meeting notes
    (
        "In the Q3 planning meeting, the infrastructure team proposed migrating "
        "the primary database from PostgreSQL 14 to PostgreSQL 16 to take "
        "advantage of improved query parallelism and logical replication "
        "enhancements. The estimated migration window is 4 hours with a "
        "rollback plan that adds another 2 hours. The product team raised "
        "concerns about feature freeze during migration. After discussion, "
        "the team agreed to schedule the migration for the last weekend of "
        "September, with a staged rollout: read replicas first, then the "
        "primary. The monitoring dashboard will track replication lag, "
        "connection pool saturation, and query latency percentiles during "
        "the cutover. Action items were assigned to Sarah for runbook prep "
        "and Marcus for load testing the new connection pooler configuration. "

    (
        "The pull request introduces a new retry mechanism for the HTTP "
        "client, but there are several concerns. First, the exponential "
        "backoff implementation does not include jitter, which could lead "
        "to thundering herd problems when multiple clients retry "
        "simultaneously. Second, the maximum retry count is hardcoded to 5 "
        "instead of being configurable. Third, the retry logic does not "
        "distinguish between transient errors (429, 503) and permanent "
        "errors (400, 404). The suggested fix is to add a RetryPolicy class "
        "that encapsulates backoff strategy, jitter range, maximum attempts, "
        "and retryable status codes. The circuit breaker integration should "
        "also be considered to prevent cascading failures when the upstream "
        "service is experiencing sustained outages. Tests should cover edge "
        "cases including timeout during retry and concurrent retry storms. "

        "attempts, and an alert triggers when the DLQ depth exceeds 100 "

        "4096 tokens could extrapolate to 16384 tokens with only a 3% "
